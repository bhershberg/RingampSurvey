# Ringamp Survey
Ring amplifiers are proving to be a useful tool for scalable switched capacitor signal processing. They continue to expand their application scope, and they regularly break records in power efficiency across the full spectrum of speeds and accuracies.

To better track the implications of this, to make comparison and reporting easy, and to provide a resource for beginners to get started, a ringamp survey and other useful materials are now [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bhershberg/RingampSurvey). This is an open source initiative, both in terms of keeping the data updated, and for adding new features. If you see something that needs to be updated or improved, please make a pull request!

# Data Sources

Some of the jupyter notbooks in this repo use code copied from the notebooks in the ADC performance survey found at https://github.com/bmurmann/ADC-survey.
