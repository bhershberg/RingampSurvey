# Ringamp Survey

Ring amplifiers are a generalizable tool for scalable switched capacitor signal processing. They continue to expand their application scope, and they regularly break records in state-of-the-art across the entire range of speeds and accuracies.

To better track the implications of this, to make comparison and reporting easy, and to provide a resource for beginners to get started, a ringamp survey and other useful materials are now available on GitHub. This is an open source initiative, both in terms of keeping the data updated, and for adding new features. Contributors encouraged.

Lastly, this survey provides a way to acknowledge everyone who has contributed to this topic. The debate and exchange of ideas is essential, and we all benefit from it. Not everyone sees ringamps through the same lens as I do, and I love that! Different people have solved different bits and pieces of the challenge, and together, we matured this topic from an simple thought experiment to high volume manufacturing, advancing core technologies that underpin the very essence of modern society.
