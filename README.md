# Ringamp Survey

The data is rolling in, and it is telling us this: ring amplifiers are a generalizable tool for scalable switched capacitor signal processing. Ringamps are appearing in diverse applications and regularly break records in state-of-the-art across the full range of speed and accuracy requirements.

To better track and understand the implications of this, to enable analysis and comparison in reporting, and to provide a place for newbies to get started, a ringamp survey and other useful materials are now available on GitHub: https://github.com/bhershberg/RingampSurvey. Please consider this very much an "open source" initiative, both for keeping the data updated and for adding new features. Help wanted!

Most important of all: I want to sincerely thank everyone who has contributed to this topic. The debate and exchange of ideas is essential, and we all benefit from it. Not everyone see ringamps through the same lens as me, and I love that. Different people have solved different bits and pieces of the challenge, and together, we matured this topic from an simple thought experiment to high volume manufacturing, enabling and advancing the core technologies that underpin modern society.
